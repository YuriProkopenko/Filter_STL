Filter
Develop a program that filters text from a given file.
The task of the program is to read the file and display it
on the screen (page by page) using the specified character set substitution
for spaces. The program should offer the following options
character sets for filtering:
- symbols of the Latin alphabet;
- Cyrillic characters;
- punctuation symbols;
- numbers.
Filters can be applied sequentially. When repeated
If an existing filter is installed, this filter must be removed.
In the program code, be sure to use the library
STL.
